## Why perform a hardware audit?

A hardware audit creates or maintains an up-to-date list of all hardware details. The reasons for doing this are:

* To enable more effective budgeting.

* To enable optimum use to be made of the available resources.

* To enable informed decisions to be made about future replacements.

* To ensure the hardware is / remains appropriate for its use.

Poor hardware inventory can result in increased cost for companies through unnecessary duplication or inefficient use of resources. In addition, costing and planning an operating system upgrade is difficult without an accurate hardware inventory.

### Involve everyone

* Ensure that everyone understands the purpose and necessity for the audit. A technician may be asked to carry out the audit by a director or high-level manager, but even so it is best to ensure that other management are fully informed and included in the audit process.

* Users also need to be treated with care. If the audit is seen as a threat then cooperation will be hard to find. Inform users of what is going on, particularly if they will be asked to fill in on-screen forms.

Everyone should be convinced of the benefits of the process in order to ensure a successful audit.

### What hardware can be audited?

Any hardware can be involved in the audit. The most common items are:

* Complete systems
* Peripherals (eg scanners, printers)
* Network hardware and connections
* Consumables (eg printer paper, toner cartridges, disks, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs)

### What sort of information can be recorded?

Information such as:

* Workstation Identification
* Hardware description
* Manufacturer
* Model
* Serial number
* Firmware version
* Port connection details

There is a considerable amount of other information that could also be recorded. You need to decide what data is 'must have', and what is 'nice to have'. Remember there is a cost associated with maintaining each item of data. It may be nice to collect additional data, but accurate collection of your must have data is more important. Ensure that you only collect data that will be updated. It is better to have no data than incorrect data.

### How to find the information

For medium and large networks, there are software audit tools available which can quickly scan all the hardware and produce the information.

For individual workstations, you can find the information using a combination of:

* Visual inspection of the hardware

* Operating system tools (Start>>Settings>>Control Panel or Start>>Programs>>Accessories>>System Tools>>System Information)

* Inspection of the BIOS entered during start-up
