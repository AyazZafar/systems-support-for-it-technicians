# Call Escalation

There will be times when you are unable to resolve the customer's enquiry using the resources at your immediate disposal. There is no shame in admitting to the customer that you are unable to answer their enquiry provided that you escalate the problem correctly and see the enquiry through to a close.

Escalation is also referred to as "Elevation". Sometimes either of these terms are used to mean making a call higher priority.

### When to Escalate a Call

You may find yourself in a situation where you need to refer your call to the manager or supervisor. For example, if the customer becomes difficult or abusive or begins to raise other, company-wide issues. As soon as you run into problems resolving a customer's enquiry, you should immediately take steps to identify your next source of assistance.

Other examples could include:

* Customer requests it or wants to speak to a manager

* The problem impacts the business

* It is a personnel issue (for example a Senior Level Manager or Executive is affected)

* No apparent solution

* More than one person is affected

* More than one department is affected

* The problem has reached its time limit for resolution according to the SLA

The general rule for escalation is: if you can't deal with it, find someone who can!

You should also remember to check the level of response guaranteed to the customer and get back to them within the time stated. It is so easy to become engrossed in finding a solution that you forget to keep in touch with the customer!

### Help Desk Call Escalation Routes

Some of the alternatives for call escalation include:

* Senior staff within the Help Desk

* Knowledge Experts / technical staff within the Help Desk

* Customer services (product returns for example)

* Suppliers and manufacturers

* Other support contractors / consultants

### Call Escalation Procedure

The key points to remember when escalating a call can be summarized as follows:

1) Identify as soon as possible the need to escalate a call.

2) Pass on as much detail as possible.

3) Obtain an estimate of the likely 'time to fix'.

4) Stay in control of the logged call - maintain dialogue with the customer.

#### Do not close the call until the customer agrees.

# Call Handling

The core activity of the Help is the support 'call'.

A 'call' could be a face-to-face request, a telephone call, a fax or e-mail, and so on.

The following process outlines some of the steps involved in the support call. A structured process can be made the basis of a Service Level Agreement between the Help Desk provider and the client to agree on the standards by which the services will be provided and measured.

1) The customer calls with a problem

2) The Help Desk advisor makes a note of the request or data is captured on a call handling system

3) The request is given a reference (or log or ticket) number

4) An acknowledgement of the call is sent back to the customer either verbally or by e-mail

5) The Help Desk Analyst responds by either solving the problem there and then, thus logging the resolution and closing the call OR escalates the problem

6) If the problem is escalated, the person that takes over the problem now has responsibility for resolving it (ownership), logging the resolution and closing the call

7) The Help Desk Analyst verifies with the customer that they are satisfied with the solution

8) The call is closed and the call log updated

9) A relationship building follow-up call is often regarded normal practice, and is beginning to be expected by the customers

# Handling Customer Complaints

All customer complaints, whether they are valid or not, should be treated with equal seriousness.

### Do not take complaints personally

Understand that an angry customer is usually frustrated that things are not working properly, or feels let down (perhaps the technician arrived late). Empathizing with the customer is a good way of developing a positive relationship towards resolving their problem. Saying you are sorry (empathizing) does not necessarily mean you agree with what the customer is saying, just that you can understand the point of view.

"I'm sorry you're having a problem with your new PC, let's see what we can do to sort things out..."

Listen while the customer explains the problem, and let them know that you are listening

On the phone, use confirmatory phrases such as "Yes", "I see", and "Uh-huh" from time to time to make sure the customer knows you are paying attention. Do not just repeat the same phrase every few seconds - the customer may think you are mocking.

If you are face-to-face with the customer, maintain eye contact and nod your head frequently but watch your body language. Do not fold your arms as this puts up a barrier.

### Be accurate and honest

A common problem when dealing with customer complaints is feeling that you have to defend every action of your company or department.

If the customer makes a true statement about your levels of service (or that of other employees), do not try and think of a clever excuse or mitigating circumstance for the failing, you will sound as if you do not care.

If you have let a customer down, it is probably best to empathize while including some positive actions:

'You're right - I'm sorry the technician didn't turn up. I guarantee that an technician will be with you by 3pm and I’ll let my supervisor know that you have had to call us. Shall I ring you back at 3.05 to make sure that things are OK?"

On the other hand, if the customer is incorrect in their understanding of the situation, empathy and correction is in order:

"I'm sorry the replacement diskette hasn't arrived, but I know it made the post. Would you be happy to wait to see whether it arrives tomorrow or should I mail another one to you?"

### Log all customer complaints

By developing the conversation using positive, fact-gathering techniques you can prove to the customer that you want to help resolve the problem. While logging the enquiry, you can confirm that you have correctly understood the customer and that the customer has the facts right.

### Agree on the steps to be taken

Having logged the complaint and worked out how to take the matter forward, tell the customer what you are going to do and confirm that your plan is acceptable to them.

You may not be able to offer the customer a complete solution on the phone if you need to obtain further information or talk to other personnel.' you should tell the customer this.

Your plan to drive the problem forward should be realistic., do not make promises you may not be able to keep. If the customer is annoyed that your organization has not returned a faulty printer in time, he or she will become extremely angry if you say that it will arrive within the next few days and it does not.

### Follow the call through

Contact the customer later to make sure the problem has been resolved to his or her satisfaction.

If the customer had a valid cause to complain about levels of service or any aspect of your company's operation, resolve the problem and then investigate what can be done to ensure this type of problem never occurs again.

# Handling Support Calls

Telephone communication will form a large part of your activities on the Help Desk. This section concentrates on telephone support calls, but many of the suggestions can be adapted for face-to-face and written communications.

The structure of a typical support call along with the skills required is as follows:

### Greeting

- Etiquette

- Attitude

### Assess the customer's problem

- Listen

- Question

- Empathy/Rapport

### Resolve or escalate the call

- Instruct

### Close the call

- Document

### Follow up

### The Greeting

You will often have heard that first impressions count. Fortunately this is true - if you can create a good first impression, the remainder of the call will be that much easier.

You could look at it the other way,. if the initial greeting does not go well, both the caller and call receiver are likely to be put "on their guard" However, establishing an effective greeting and first impression is not hard to do.

### Greeting goal

The goal of your greeting should be to:

* Identify yourself, your organization and/or department

* Offer assistance, using the customer's name

It is vital to establish the customers name from the greeting. It is equally vital that you establish how to pronounce it correctly and how to spell it correctly. Once you have learned the customer’s name, you should use it throughout the call. This will help to establish a rapport with the client.

Call management technology will often identify a customer to you, displaying personal details, such as name and organization, and details of previous calls.

### Developing a greeting

Never, never, just say "Hello". Use "Good morning" or "Good afternoon", followed by your name and/or department, and probably the department function. This gives the right touch of interest and conveys enthusiasm.

All this is very flexible, but should end up as something like "Good afternoon, Ann Jones, Help Desk. How may I help you today?".

Even though you may have a "standard greeting", it is important to make it sound personal and welcoming.

What you put into the greeting should be maintained throughout the call.

# Ownership

Ownership is the problem of who is responsible for the logged call if the problem is escalated. There are two types of ownership to consider: actual and perceived.

### Actual ownership

The person who is dealing with the problem; if you have escalated it to someone else, they have ownership.

### Perceived ownership

As you initially took the call, your customer perceives that you have ownership even though you may be handing ownership to another level or area of expertise. So the customer expects you to keep in touch with them and keep them informed at each phase of the problem-solving process.

### Managing ownership

A call management system in which calls or tasks can be assigned and which can prompt the user with reminders automatically is a great help in managing the complexity of having more than one person work on a support call.

When escalating the call, you must provide the customer with a reasonable time frame of response. This does not have to be the time when the problem will be fixed, but the time when they can next expect to hear from the Help Desk.

### The most important thing is for the customer to be contacted within

the agreed time frame. The procedures for the Help Desk should set out a process for ensuring that this happens (for example, recording contact in a management application).


It is good practice for the Help Desk to contact the customer after the first call both because of the positive impression it creates and because it is better to encourage clients not to make 'progress report" calls, as these waste analysts' time.

However, a client may prefer to telephone to find out the status of a problem (for example, if they are uncertain of how they can be contacted within the time period specified).
