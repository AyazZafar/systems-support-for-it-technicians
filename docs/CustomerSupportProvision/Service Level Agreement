## What is a Service Level Agreement

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a promise to provide a specific service to a specific standard which has been agreed between the customer and the Help Desk.

The SLA is beneficial to both parties as it establishes the scope of the support to be offered and the scope of the support that can be expected to by the customer. The SLA ensures that no 'arguments' arise about what is covered through the Help Desk. If used properly it should:

* Identify and define the customer’s needs

* Provide a framework for understanding

* Simplify complex issues

* Reduce areas of conflict

* Encourage dialogue in the event of disputes

* Eliminate unrealistic expectations

Specifically it should embrace a wide range of issues. Amongst these are usually the following:

* Services to be delivered

* Performance, Tracking and Reporting

* Problem Management

* Legal Compliance and Resolution of Disputes

* Customer Duties and Responsibilities

* Security

* Termination

### Definition of Services

This is the most critical section of the Agreement as it describes the services and the manner in which those services are to be delivered. Standard services are often separated from customised services but this distinction is not critical.

The information on the services must be accurate and contain detailed specifications of exactly what is being delivered.

### Performance Management

A key part of a Service Level Agreement deals with monitoring and measuring service level performance. Essentially, every service must be capable of being measured and the results analysed and reported. The benchmarks, targets and metrics to be used must be specified in the agreement itself.

The service performance level must be reviewed regularly by the two parties.

### Problem Management
The purpose of problem management is to minimise the adverse impact of incidents and problems. This usually specifies that there must be an adequate process to handle and resolve unplanned incidents and that there must also be preventative activity to reduce occurrence of unplanned incidents.

Formal records and logs must be maintained of all incidents and problems.

### Customer Duties and Responsibilities

It is important for the customer to understand that it also has responsibilities to support the service delivery process. The SLA defines the 'relationship' which of course is a two way entity.

Typically, the customer must arrange for access, facilities and resources for the supplier’s employees who need to work on-site.

### Warranties and Remedies

This section of the SLA agreement typically covers the following key topics:

* Service quality

* Indemnities

* Third party claims

* Remedies for breaches

* Exclusions

### Security

Security is a particularly critical feature of any SLA.

The customer must provide controlled physical and logical access to its premises and information. Equally, the supplier must respect and comply with the Client’s security policies and procedures.

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

Disaster recovery and business continuity can be of critical importance. This fact should be reflected within the SLA.

The topic is disaster recovery is usually embraced within the security section. However, it is also frequently included within the Problem Management area.

At the highest level, both these areas typically state that there must be adequate provision for disaster recovery and business continuity planning to protect the continuity of the services being delivered.

### Termination

This section of the SLA agreement typically covers the following key topics:

* Termination at end of initial term

* Termination for convenience

* Termination for cause

* Payments on terminatioN
