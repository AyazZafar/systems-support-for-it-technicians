### Determining User Needs

You have a Saturday job as assistant receptionist with your Aunt. She is an Optician with a shop on the High Street. Her business is run using completely manual systems i.e. Letter sent out to patients are produced on a typewriter, patient records are paper-based-and stored filing cabinets and patient charges are calculated using pen, paper and a calculator.

One Saturday your Aunt tells you that she has been considering modernising her business and buying a computer to help. She has read many advertisements and looked around a couple of computer shops and is thoroughly confused. She knows you are doing an ICT course at college and asks you what you think she should buy.

What sort of manual systems do you think she will have? The following are likely:

* Patient records. There will be a need for every patient that she has

* Letters will need to be produced

* She will need to keep track of her patient charges

All of these systems are suitable for computerisation and may be achieved by the following means:

* A database system to keep patient records up to date and readily accessible

* A word processing system to improve the production of letters

* A spreadsheet package to help her produce her customer invoices etc

What else might be her user needs? For example she might be quite happy with the word processing system overall but might 'ask if there is a way to automate standard letters. It may be decided to write a macro for them. Is there anything else she might need? For example, templates, directory folders etc.
