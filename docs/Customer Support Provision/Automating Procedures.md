### Macros

A macro is a short piece of code which performs a simple task. If you find you need to perform a particular task repeatedly within a single software application, it could be productive to create a macro. Creating the macro will take a little time, but should save you a lot of time thereafter. Macros help you to automate routine tasks, so as a support technician you should encourage end users to think about using macros to increase their productivity.

Macros are available in many software applications. The language used for macros within Microsoft applications is Visual Basic. You could learn how to write Visual Basic code, but macro wizards are supplied to make the macro writing as simple as possible.

In Word, a macro will replace a series of Word commands:

* to speed up routine editing and formatting, e.g. to change the case of a selected piece of text to 'all caps'

* to replace a series of commands, e.g. to insert a table with a specific size and borders, and with a specific number of rows and columns

* to increase the accessibility of an option in a dialogue box

* to automate a complex series of tasks

### Automated Scheduling

Keeping track of what has to be done, especially tasks like backups that may need to be done daily, weekly or monthly, is best done electronically.

Some software applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, incorporate a calendar or diary with scheduling options. You can use these tools to plan events and to co-ordinate meetings with others within the same organisation. However, these tools simply remind you about what has to be done, rather than doing it for you. Automated scheduling is a more powerful tool, and most useful for essential tasks like taking backups.

The Windows operating system provides a Task Scheduler, which allows you to schedule tasks to run at a time that is most convenient for you. The Task Scheduler software starts each time you start Windows, and runs in the background.

* You can schedule a task to run daily, weekly, monthly, or at certain times (such as system start-up).

* You can change the schedule for a task.

* You can stop a scheduled task.

* You can customise how a task runs at a scheduled time.

The Windows operating system also provides software so that you can backup files on your hard disk, either on to floppy disks, a tape drive, or another computer on your network. If your original files are damaged or lost, you can restore them from the backup. (The Backup software can be found in Start>>Programs>>Accessories>>System Tools.)

### Templates

A template is a master document, which determines the main features of other documents of a given type, and dictates what should (and should not) be included, as well as how the information within the document should look.

There are a limited number of standard documents:

* Business Letter 
* Sales Invoice 
* Purchase Order 
* Memo
* Fax Cover Sheet 
* Report 
* Web Page.

When creating a new document in Word, if you select File>>New, you are offered all available templates on your system. There are many standards template to choose from, all conveniently grouped by type.

### Benefits of automated procedures

The aim is to provide a user with a simple and positive image of the technology they use. There will be situations that technicians and support staff can identify that would make the user's daily life easier, such as using automated procedures. This is what computers are for. Make them do the work for you.

In the everyday use of computer systems you can instigate the following automated procedures.
* Set up new styles in a word processing application to save time and effort.
* Create a simple macro in Excel or Word to carry out a routine task.
* Add a button to an application to save time and effort.
* Ensure that some spelling corrections are automated.
* If required, automate scheduled data transfers.
* Configure your email application to automate email send and receive at regular intervals.
* Where appropriate, automate regular backups.

### What to Automate?

* You might set up new styles for someone who is an extensive user of Word
* Adding simple macros might reduce repeated tasks or make a process accessible for someone with a disability.
* You could add a button (or buttons) to an application for ease of use.
* You might automate spelling corrections for someone who has to type many technical terms. This can also be used for someone with an autistic spectrum disorder such as dyslexia.
* You could schedule data transfers to ensure that essential data is sent to a remote location.
* You might automate email send and receive to ensure that a user's mail system is up to date.
* You could complete an automated backup to ensure that critical data is safe.
