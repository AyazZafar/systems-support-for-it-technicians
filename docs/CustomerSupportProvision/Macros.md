## What is a Macro?

A Macro records keystrokes and menu selections, then plays them back exactly as they were recorded. A macro can be created so that a commonly used task can be performed, or a word, phrase or paragraph can be entered automatically. The use of macros results in the more efficient production of documents. Once macros have been created, they can be used at any time in any document that uses the same template. Word has many pre-programmed macros.
