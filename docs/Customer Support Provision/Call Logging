# Documenting Customer Requirments

### Why is documentation important?

It is important that all the records of user requests be available to all members of the team. If a user calls the help desk again about the same problem, he or she may not be able to speak to the same member of the support team, so whoever answers must be able to look back at the history of the problem.

All notes should also be clear - both legible (if handwritten) and understandable. Do not use abbreviations that only you understand.

It is tempting to make very brief (or no) notes of trivial problems, but this should be resisted. This is because the information you keep can be used for a number of other purposes. For example, if one user asks several very basic questions, then it will indicate to the managers that the person needs extra training. Similarly, if the same apparently trivial question is asked by several people then this might suggest that the software or hardware need to be checked and possibly reconfigured.

### How should an end user request be recorded?

You should record the full details of the request from the user.

* Reference number - the form should provide a reference number for each request. If the form is on paper each form should be given a reference number in sequence - the reference number could be pre-printed on the forms. If the form is on-screen then the software will normally assign a unique reference number to each request.

* Date - this is the date when the request is made. An on-screen form may record the date and time automatically.

* Time - again, this is the time when the request is made, not the time when the problem first appeared.

* Name of end user - it may be necessary to check the user's login ID as well. In a large organisation it may be necessary to verify the user in some way - this would be part of the security procedures of the company.

* Workstation - employees may be able to log in on any computer in a network, so the machine that is being used must be identified.

* End user request - this should be written down exactly as said by the end user.

### How should the nature of the problem be recorded?

End users do not always explain the problem very clearly.

Suppose the user says 'My printer isn't working.' This could mean:

* the printer does not do anything at all

* the printer was working but has now stopped

* paper goes through the printer but comes out blank

* the printing is patchy or smeared

* the printout does not appear as expected.

It is very important that you do not jump to conclusions, so the exact words used should be recorded as the end user request. The nature of the problem should be described in much more detail. A few simple questions to the user should enable you to describe the problem properly.

### How should the actions of the support staff be recorded?

As you work towards a solution you should fill in the remaining sections of the form:

* Name of help desk staff - it is very important to state who worked on the problem. This can be useful if the user wants to speak to the same person again. The manager will also use this information to check on the performance of the support staff.

* Nature of the problem - this is the full description of the problem.

* Advice given - all advice given should be noted down.

* Resources used - here you should list any resources that you referred to in order to so the problem

* Date/time problem was resolved - this should be completed only when the end user is satisfied that the problem has been resolved.

Â· Further action - if the end user calls again later and says that the problem is still present, then further action may be necessary, and this should be noted. You need to work out the best way of recording this further action.

### What information should I give to the end user?

The end user should always be told the name of the person who is providing the help, and the reference number for the request. If an end user has the same problem again, he or she should mention the reference number, so the help desk staff can find the original form and check what advice was given before.

### Documentation

Being on hand to fix problems is fine, but documenting the problem (from the initial request for help right through to the eventual resolution) is also an important part of the process. The documentation will help to identify many important factors:

* frequently asked questions

* hardware which fails too often through mishandling

* consumables which are used too quickly

* individual end users who request support more often than their colleagues

* hardware which proves to be unreliable

* volumes of work which cannot be processed on existing equipment

* software faults

* occurrence of viruses.

This information may help to identify problems that can be solved and the resources needed for resolution and result in the following outcomes:

* preparation of user-friendly documentation which answers the most frequently asked questions

* training in the correct handling of equipment

* extra training for individuals who are identified as needing special coaching to overcome their tendency to rely on the support technicians

* selection of alternative hardware suppliers with more reliable products

* budgeting to increase the processing power of the hardware and software available to users

8 need for identification of software errors and their correction by patches or downloads

* protection against viruses by software and/or user procedures.

# Procedures for Collecting & Recording Support Data

The hotdesk, even if it is just one person manning the incoming calls from end users, will have a system of logging calls and recording all the relevant details of the end user's problem. The same system will be updated as progress is made on any particular problem, either by the hotdesk assistant entering information taken from reports completed by the engineers, or by engineers themselves.

What kind of information might be recorded? As with any management information system, it is important to retain all information that will help to keep track of progress in solving any particular fault that has been reported, and which may help to prevent similar problems happening in the future. Here are some questions that the computerised call-logging system should be able to answer:

* Who reported the fault?

* When was it reported (the exact time as well as the date)?

* Who was assigned to deal with this problem? At what time did this happen,?

* What action did the engineer decide upon? When did this take place?

* What was the actual problem? End user error? Faulty hardware? Faulty software?

* Has the problem been fixed? If so, how was it fixed?

* Cost of repair (in terms of replacement equipment, engineers' time)?

#### Additional information can be gathered by analysing the data as follows:

* Are there any individuals who call in more regularly than others, and who could benefit from some extra training in the use of IT equipment and/or software?

* Are any items of hardware failing too often? Should an alternative hardware provider be found?

* Are the engineers coping with the flow of faults fast enough? Are additional support engineers needed?

# Designing User Support Procedures

### How is information about user requests recorded?

All requests for user support must be recorded in some way. As we have seen, most of these requests will come over the phone, so it is normal for the user support staff to record the details whilst talking to the end user. This information can be collected on a paper form or keyed in on-screen.

Most help desks use standard help desk software, which allows them to record all the information about a user support request. Help desk software is essentially a database which holds all the information about each request for support and about how the problems were solved.

But it is not necessary to use an expensive help desk package. It is not difficult to design Your own simple database and forms.

If the problem is solved by visiting the workplace then a paper form will be used.

How do I design a form to collect user requests?

The form will record two sorts of information - information about the user request and information about how the problem was solved. These will be recorded whether the form is on paper or on-screen.

The information about the user request will begin with some reference data:

* reference number
* date
* time.

All the remaining data relating to the user request has to be collected directly from the user. This will include the following:

* name of end user
* workstation
* end user request.

### What do I add to the form to record the Support given?

The form, whether on paper or on-screen, should record the help given and whether it solved the problem:

* name of help desk staff
* nature of the problem
* advice given
* resources used
* date/time problem was resolved
* further action.

#### It is just as important to record what does not work as well as what does.

# Documenting Support Calls

In a Help Desk environment, it is not practical to expect to remember the details of each call. Attempting to do so will lead to lost calls, frustration and poor customer service.

The value of documentation in terms of the current call is to:

* Preserve accurate information
* Provide observation not opinion
* Record details not generalizations

Documentation has additional value in terms of organizing and optimising the activities of the Help Desk organization:

* Analyse call data (frequency of callers, frequency of questions, frequency of particular topics or components). This information can be used to optimise support centre activities (for example, establish bulletin boards, Frequently Asked Questions or automated responses to common problems, distribute resolutions of difficult problems, and so on).

* Solve future problems efficiently by storing resolutions in a knowledge management system.

* Analyse the product - information received can be input back into the product development cycle.

Depending on the technology available, calls may be documented by hand (writing notes), in a word processor or database, in a contact application or in a call management system.

However the call is documented, it is important that the notes be:

* Clear and legible
* Well-organized (using standard fields)
* Accessible (to other members of the Help Desk)

## Possible Entries in a Call Logging System

### Call ID
A unique reference number is used to identify each particular call and all subsequent action taken to resolve the fault.

### Date & Time of Initial Call
It is important to record the time as well as the date. Some faults will be reported and solved within the space of a couple of hours. Others may take longer.

### Who Initiated the Call
The person who called may be noted by their name and department, or by an employee ID code, linked to other databases held by the company. This may allow the identification employees who regularly call for IT support, and may need to be given extra training.

### Engineer Allocated to Supervise the Solution
The hotdesk assistant will need to make an initial decision as to who best can help the caller. This will be based on information given by the caller, and the hotdesk assistant may have a questionnaire to complete which also helps to decide whether the fault is mostly hardware or software related.

### Data and Time of Passing Information to Engineer
A delay in passing details of the problem on to an engineer will mean the end user might be waiting longer than he or she needs to. Keeping track of this data will ensure more efficient processing by the hotdesk assistant.

### Report from Engineer(s)
This may include information such as what equipment was repaired on site, what equipment was removed for repair, what loan equipment was given to the user as a temporary fix, or what replacement equipment was given to the user as a permanent fix. Each event needs a date and time of action so that progress can be monitored.

### Error Diagnosis
Details of exactly what went wrong and how it was fixed will help if other users call in with similar problems.

### Costs (money)
Equipment that is supplied to replace faulty equipment can be charged to a particular reported fault.

### Costs (time)
Time spent repairing equipment or on-site with an end user, trying to diagnose the problem, needs to be accounted for and charged against each call.

### Recommendations
Lessons learned in solving a problem should be recorded and considered when making decisions about staffing levels within the support team, the equipment that is to be purchased in the future and training needs of support staff and end users.
