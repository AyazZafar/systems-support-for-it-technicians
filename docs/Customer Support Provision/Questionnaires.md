# Gathering Information on Customers' Use of Existing Resources

In order to provide effective support to customers, it is frequently necessary to gather information on their use of existing resources. This could be through the use of:

* questionnaires
* analysis of documents such as user logs, support logs, event or audit logs, access logs
* observation
* interview

Reference to these sources can be used to support any recommendations you make, such as determining automated procedures.

### Questionnaires

Questionnaires can be useful where you need to gather information from lots of people. However, the questionnaire will need careful wording to make sure the correct information is gathered.

### Types of questions

Questions can be general, open or closed. General questions ask for simple factual information (eg What is your name?). Open questions simply leave space for users to say whatever they like in response (eg What improvements could be made to the system?). Closed questions allow the users to select from a fixed number of options. Closed questions can be posed as multiple-choice questions, where the users can select from several possible options, with tick boxes for the responses.

### Analysis

The information obtained usually has to be analysed with reference to the person who answered the questions. Hence background information such as age range, salary range or occupation, is needed.

### General points
When preparing a questionnaire, bear the following points in mind:

* Keep the questionnaire short and order the questions in the most logical sequence.

* Make the wording of the instructions simple and keep the questions short.

* Use open/closed questions as appropriate, and check for vague or ambiguous questions.

* Remember to thank the respondent.

# Using Questions Effectively

The purpose of questioning is to find out what the caller knows about the problem as quickly as possible.

There are two types of questioning that you can use to obtain information. Each type of questioning has its particular place in your "knowledge gathering toolkit".

## Open and Closed Questions

### Closed questions

A closed question is a question where the answer can only be 'yes' or 'no', or a question which includes only two options, such as 'Would you like tea or coffee?". Another type of closed question is one that can produce only one answer (for example, 'What is the error number shown in the dialogue box?").

### Open questions

An open question gives the person answering the question some flexibility in their response ('What were you doing when the problem occurred?"). An open question is open to interpretation, so it is important to use the question to guide the caller towards the answer you need.

### When to use open and closed questions

The basic approach is to use an open question to establish the field of enquiry then use closed questions to narrow the field and isolate the problem.

You may find that the caller is unable to answer your closed questions. This could happen for a number of reasons. At this point, it may be worth asking another open question, to get "back on track". People will find a long series of closed questions quite aggressive and threatening, especially if they are uncertain of the answers. In this case, you need to make sure your tone and manner are as soothing as possible.

On the other hand, several open questions in a row may confuse a user, especially if they are not confident. Closed questions allow you to focus the user's mind on a precise point and help you to retain control of the support call.
