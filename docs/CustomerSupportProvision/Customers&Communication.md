## What is a Customer?

The customer is the person who pays your salary. Without customers, your business has no means of making a profit and therefore no means of paying you.

It is imperative then that the contact you have with customers is productive, agreeable and satisfying on every single occasion.

The goal of your contact with each customer is to remain in charge of the 'conversation' and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.

### The Importance of Empathy

Empathy is the ability to fully comprehend another person by being in rapport.

Empathy means responding to the customer's emotional state and putting yourself in the customers place and point-of-view.

Empathy has the following advantages in communications:

* Builds a relationship with the customer

* Helps them to develop trust in you

* Helps you to understand the customer and their needs

* Helps you to realize the difficulties that the problem is causing the customer

* Helps you get into the customers shoes

* Allows the customer to tell you how they feel

Note that empathy does not simply mean feeling sorry for the customer or joining them in hating the particular piece of software that they are being asked to use without any formal training...

Empathy means matching your responses to the customers without taking on their emotional state, in order to put them at ease and resolve the call quickly.

### Customer Service Skills

A good service technician should not only have a good understanding of technical matters, but must also be a good communicator.

It is easy to pick up facts and information, but it can be much harder to use this information in a trouble-shooting scenario requiring customer interaction, either face-to-face or over the telephone.

These two areas go hand-in hand., a person with only one of these skills is not likely to be a good customer service technician. Learning how to deal with customers, interpret the information they give you, and respond to their queries can be difficult, but understanding a few key issues is extremely helpful.

Four simple, golden rules can be applied to good customer service as follows...

* Be in control

* Be positive and confident

* Drive the issue forward

* Be consistent
