## What is a Logon Script

A logon script is a small program or batch file that executes automatically when a user logs on to a particular computer system.

These scripts can use system environment variables to set the client machine's time, map drive letters to network resources, display a message on the screen, redirect printing to shared network printers, and can also start other scripts or executable programs.

You can use a text editor such as Notepad to create logon scripts and then use the User Properties page to assign different logon scripts to different users, or assign the same logon script to multiple users.
