### Call Escalation

There will be times when you are unable to resolve the customer's enquiry using the resources at your immediate disposal. There is no shame in admitting to the customer that you are unable to answer their enquiry provided that you escalate the problem correctly and see the enquiry through to a close.

Escalation is also referred to as "Elevation". Sometimes either of these terms are used to mean making a call higher priority.

### When to Escalate a Call

You may find yourself in a situation where you need to refer your call to the manager or supervisor. For example, if the customer becomes difficult or abusive or begins to raise other, company-wide issues. As soon as you run into problems resolving a customer's enquiry, you should immediately take steps to identify your next source of assistance.

Other examples could include:

* Customer requests it or wants to speak to a manager

* The problem impacts the business

* It is a personnel issue (for example a Senior Level Manager or Executive is affected)

* No apparent solution

* More than one person is affected

* More than one department is affected

* The problem has reached its time limit for resolution according to the SLA

The general rule for escalation is: if you can't deal with it, find someone who can!

You should also remember to check the level of response guaranteed to the customer and get back to them within the time stated. It is so easy to become engrossed in finding a solution that you forget to keep in touch with the customer!

### Help Desk Call Escalation Routes

Some of the alternatives for call escalation include:

* Senior staff within the Help Desk

* Knowledge Experts / technical staff within the Help Desk

* Customer services (product returns for example)

* Suppliers and manufacturers

* Other support contractors / consultants

### Call Escalation Procedure

The key points to remember when escalating a call can be summarized as follows:

1) Identify as soon as possible the need to escalate a call.

2) Pass on as much detail as possible.

3) Obtain an estimate of the likely 'time to fix'.

4) Stay in control of the logged call - maintain dialogue with the customer.

#### Do not close the call until the customer agrees.
